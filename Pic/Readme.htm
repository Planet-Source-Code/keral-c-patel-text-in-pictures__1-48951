<p><font color="#0080C0">Hi Everybody, this is me again. I can't keep my hands 
  off this Shift key. So Don't mind this at all. Now for this Code. This Code 
  will enable you to encrypt text into the Image. It must be BMP though. You can 
  send this Pic to your friend and if your friend has this Prog and knows the 
  password then he will be able to read the message that you have Typed in the 
  Image. Comments are most welcomed. But don't make silly Comments because my 
  last Month was just full of them. I don't want any trouble this time. Bye and 
  use this if you find it useful for any of your Work. Or just send an Encrypted 
  message to your geeky girlfriend. She will be happy.</font></p>

  But I like Blue Color very much. And This Music, it is stolen from a Hacking 
  Website.</font></p>
